**CSE Manim Animation Roadmap**
A structured roadmap for creating animated visualizations of core Computer Science concepts using **Manim**. Organized in progressive phases—from beginner-friendly math and geometry to advanced algorithms, AI/ML, and systems simulations—this repo helps you build strong animation skills while reinforcing key CSE topics.

**Features:**

* **Phase 1:** Math & Geometry basics (Numbers, Functions, Shapes, Transformations)
* **Phase 2:** Algorithms & Data Structures (Sorting, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
* **Phase 3:** Networks & OS (Packet routing, Scheduling, Deadlocks)
* **Phase 4:** Databases (B-Trees, Hashing, Query Execution)
* **Phase 5:** AI/ML (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Clustering, PCA)
* **Phase 6:** Theory & Cryptography (Automata, Turing Machines, RSA, Hashing)
* **Phase 7:** Advanced Simulations (Concurrency, Git Workflows, 3D Graphics)

**Goal:** Learn Manim step-by-step, visualize abstract CSE concepts, and create clear, dynamic, and reusable animations.

### **Roadmap Tips**

* Start **simple**, like sorting or geometric shapes, then move to **dynamic systems**.
* Use **color coding and labels** to make the animation clear.
* Combine **math, arrows, and text** for conceptual clarity.
* For 3D animations, explore `ThreeDScene` and camera rotations.
* Reuse animation templates (e.g., `ArrayAnimation`, `GraphTraversal`) for efficiency.
